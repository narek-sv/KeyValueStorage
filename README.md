## Installation

### [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/)

Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding KeyValueStorage as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/narek-sv/KeyValueStorage.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.1"))
]
```

In any file you'd like to use KeyValueStorage in, don't forget to
import the framework with `import KeyValueStorage`.

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate KeyValueStorage into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'KeyValueStorageSwift'
```

Then run `pod install`.

In any file you'd like to use KeyValueStorage in, don't forget to
import the framework with `import KeyValueStorageSwift`.
